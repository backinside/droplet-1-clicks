Pure installation takes up the following space for the examples and virtual environments.

(openvino_notebooks) ubuntu@jupyter-test:~$ du -sh examples/
463M    examples/
(openvino_notebooks) ubuntu@jupyter-test:~$ 
(openvino_notebooks) ubuntu@jupyter-test:~$ du -sh ~/.conda/envs/openvino_notebooks/
3.5G    /home/ubuntu/.conda/envs/openvino_notebooks/
(openvino_notebooks) ubuntu@jupyter-test:~$ du -sh ~/.conda/envs/stable-diffusion-1.5/5.3G    /home/ubuntu/.conda/envs/stable-diffusion-1.5/

That is 9GB+. As you work through examples, models will be downloaded and cached (under ~/.cache), and that will quickly increase the space usage.

If you want to clean up the space and do not need the examples, just do the following.

Step 1:
\rm -rf ~/examples  # This will delete the entire example folder

Step 2: 
(openvino_notebooks) ubuntu@jupyter-test:~$ conda env list
# conda environments:
#
jupyter                  /home/ubuntu/.conda/envs/jupyter
openvino_notebooks    *  /home/ubuntu/.conda/envs/openvino_notebooks
stable-diffusion-1.5     /home/ubuntu/.conda/envs/stable-diffusion-1.5
base                     /opt/conda

(openvino_notebooks) ubuntu@jupyter-test:~$ conda env remove -y -n <env_name>

This should clean up the entire environment, saving you ~9GB.

Step 3:
Time to time, you can clean up the ~/.cache. Look for those unused models taking GBs of space.
